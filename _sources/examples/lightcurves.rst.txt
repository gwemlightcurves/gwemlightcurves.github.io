Introduction
============
In this chapter, we discuss kilonova light curves and what goes into some of the modeling behind them. Many good references exist such as
Metzger and the `Kilonova Handbook <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.09381.pdf>`_

In the kilonova handbook, one can generally imagine the themral energy of a given shell of the mass ejecta evolving as `Equation 14 <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1610.09381.pdf#equation.4.14>`_
